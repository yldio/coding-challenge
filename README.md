# YLD Coding Challenge

## :trophy: What are we doing?

We are putting together a guerrilla recruitment campaign to hire some great
Node and React devs. This campaign will involve a technical challenge that
candidates will have to solve, to apply for a job with us.  The challenge will
take the form of an incomplete website, with a react front end and a hapi
backend.  The contestants will be expected to finish the website by completing
a new page to demonstrate front-end skills which shows the result of some
algorithmic component to demonstrate their back-end engineering skills.

## :question: Why are we doing this?

We love working with the best people, and when we hire itâ€™s the time to get the
very best co-workers.  We all know the pool of talent is surprisingly small
and acknowledge that our networks only reach so far, so we're trying to find
creative ways to reach beyond our networks to filter out and attract the very
best.

## :octocat: How can you help?

In order to make the campaign appealing to candidates, we would like your
ideas for:

1. **A theme** - Create an issue if you have an idea for a great theme that
would be of interest to developers and would intrigue them to take on the
challenge.  (fun but safe for work pleeeeease)
2. **An algorithm** - Ideas for algorithms that they can solve in a couple
hours.
3. Please vote for the ideas you like best
4. If you think you have a better idea add an issue with your idea
5. Comment on existing ideas to further develop them, e.g.
 * Fun strapline to engage candidates
 * Design ideas
 * Any copy
 * Links to examples
 * Previous challenges

Ideas can be partially thought out - Even a one line idea about a theme. It's
entirely fine for the idea to be a seed for discussion and you should feel free
to suggest enhancements or changes to existing ideas, *including this readme!*
Just submit a pull request if you want to add or change anything here.

## :hammer: How will we judge submissions?

* Clean, logical git commits.
* Good git commit messages
* Follow git blesssed commit message style
* All commits are green (pass tests) and pass lint
* Correct implementation
* Consistent code style
* Quality of algorithm implementation
* Good and appropriate test coverage

## :mega: How will we promote it?

* Hubspot
* YLD twitter
* Bradley's linkedin
