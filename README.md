# YLD Recruitment Challenge

We are putting together a campaign to hire some great Node and React devs. This
campaign will involve a technical challenge that candidates will have to solve,
to apply for a job with us.  

Ideas can be partially thought out - Even a one line idea about a theme. It's
entirely fine for the idea to be a seed for discussion and you should feel free
to suggest enhancements or changes to existing ideas, *including this readme!*
Just submit a pull request if you want to add or change anything here.

In order to make the campaign appealing to candidates, we would like your 
ideas for:

1. *A theme* - Create an issue if you have an idea for a great theme that would 
be of interest to developers and would intrigue them to take on the challenge. 
(fun but safe for work pleeeeease)
2. *An algorithm* - Ideas for algorithms that they can solve in a couple hours.
3. Please vote for the ideas you like best
4. If you think you have a better idea add an issue with your idea
5. Comment on existing ideas to further develop them, e.g.
 * Fun strapline to engage candidates
 * Design ideas
 * Any copy
 * Links to examples
 * Previous challenges
