# YLD Recruitment Challenge

We are putting together a campaign to hire some great Node and React devs. This
campaign will involve a technical challenge that candidates will have to solve,
to apply for a job with us.  In order to make the campaign appealing to
candidates, I would like your inputs on:

1. THEME - Ideas for a great theme that would be of interest to developers
and would intrigue them to take on the challenge. For example: Lego bricks,
themes from video games from the 80s/90s, shibas, Star Wars characters, etc.
(fun but safe for work pleeeeease)
2. ALGORITHM -  Ideas for algorithms that they can solve in a couple hours.
Please create an issue for each idea here, tagging it with either “Theme”
or “Algorithm"
3. Please vote for the ideas you like best
4. If you think you have a better idea add an issue with your idea
