                      <p>Welcome to the first YLD Coding Challenge! 🔥🔥🔥</p>
                      <p>You are tasked in writing a function that returns the deciphered string input into readable text. 💪<br/>
                        The function can be named what ever you want it to be named!
                        <br/>
                      </p>
                    <h4>Examples</h4>
                    <p>
                      An example application that works could take the string <code>Bar lyq!</code> as an argument which is then deciphered and returned as "One yld!" 1️⃣.
                      <pre><code>
{`<?php
  function rot13($string) {
      return str_rot13($string);
  }
?>`}
                      </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Categories</h4>
                    <p><ol>
                      <li>🗜️ Smallest working solution in bytes (look up "language-of-choice code golf")</li>
                      <li>🏎️ Most performant solution</li>
                      <li>🐎 Most esoteric solution (complex, using monads, built 100% in css) for example</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <h4>Rules</h4>
                    <p>Your solution can be in any language, just make sure you provide instructions on how to run!<br/>
                      You <strong>can</strong> work in a group, or on your own!
                        <br/>
                      External modules / libraries will count towards the smallest solution size.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to submit</h4>
                    <p>Slack your solution to (@tomgco) privately with instructions on how to run, the winner will be announced after the next YLD MCM on the Friday, 11th October 2019 and then sent to #group-engineering</p>
                    <h4>Questions or Hints</h4>
                    <p>Please raise them on <Link href="https://yld.slack.com/archives/CEFCP0Z26/p1568646863018100">#group-engineering</Link> in slack or to @tomgco directly.</p>
                    <h4>Closing Date</h4>
                    <p>Tuesday 8th October 2019</p>
